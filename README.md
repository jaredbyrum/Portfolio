## Portfolio
 # Description
 Portfolio site showing CSS fundamentals and to showf my projects I've completed for future employers. Using FlexBox, display:grid, and transitions to make an appealing website that is nice to use. It should have a responsive design, functional links to other parts the site, and when you click on a badge for one the projects it should take you to a live deployed site. 

 # USAGE 
 This Portfolio is intended solely for the use the creator (Jared Byrum) and to be viewed by the grading team and by future employers.
